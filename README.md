📌 Features
Calculates the dot product of two vectors using a function.

Demonstrates basic pointer use and array manipulation.

Includes inline comments for beginner-friendly understanding.

💡 What is a Dot Product?
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding entries. For vectors A and B:

Dot Product = A₁*B₁ + A₂*B₂ + A₃*B₃ + ... + Aₙ*Bₙ

🧾 Example in This Program
Given:

Vector 1: {8, 16, 32}

Vector 2: {5, 9, 13}

The dot product is calculated as:

(8*5) + (16*9) + (32*13) = 40 + 144 + 416 = 600

🛠 How to Compile and Run
Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.

Compile
g++ -o dot_product main.cpp

Run
./dot_product

📄 File Overview
main.cpp: Contains the dot product function and the main() method to demonstrate it.

🧠 Learning Objectives
